PyOxidizer Rust Projects
========================

PyOxidizer uses Rust projects to build binaries embedding Python. This
documentation describes how they work. If you are only interested in
embedding Python in a Rust application without using PyOxidizer as part
of the regular development workflow, see
:ref:`pyoxidizer_rust_generic_embedding` for instructions.

If you just have a standalone configuration file (such as when running
``pyoxidizer init-config-file``), a temporary Rust project will be
created as part of building binaries. That project will be built, its
build artifacts copied, and the temporary project will be deleted.

If you use ``pyoxidizer init-rust-project`` to initialize a
``PyOxidizer`` application, the Rust project exists side-by-side with
the ``PyOxidizer`` configuration file and can be modified like
any other Rust project.

.. _rust_project_layout:

Layout
======

Generated Rust projects all have a similar layout::

   $ find pyapp -type f | grep -v .git
   .cargo/config
   Cargo.toml
   Cargo.lock
   build.rs
   pyapp.exe.manifest
   pyapp-manifest.rc
   pyoxidizer.bzl
   src/main.rs

The ``Cargo.toml`` file is the configuration file for the Rust project.
Read more in
`the official Cargo documentation <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html>`_.
The magic lines in this file to enable PyOxidizer are the following::

   [package]
   build = "build.rs"

   [dependencies]
   pyembed = ...

These lines declare a dependency on the ``pyembed`` package, which holds
the smarts for running an embedded Python interpreter.

In addition, the ``build = "build.rs"`` helps to dynamically configure the
crate.

Next let's look at ``src/main.rs``. If you aren't familiar with Rust
projects, the ``src/main.rs`` file is the default location for the source
file implementing an executable. If we open that file, we see a
``fn main() {`` line, which declares the *main* function for our executable.
The file is relatively straightforward. We import some symbols from the
``pyembed`` crate. We then construct a config object, use that to construct
a Python interpreter, then we run the interpreter and pass its exit code
to ``exit()``. Succinctly, we instantiate and run an embedded Python
interpreter. That's our executable.

The ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` is our auto-generated
:ref:`PyOxidizer configuration file <config_files>` with an additional `runtime` option set to the current directory.
This specifies that we want this project to be used as the pyembed runner instead of a temporary one.

Crate Features
==============

The auto-generated Rust project defines a number of features to control
behavior when building via cargo. These are documented in the sections below.

``build-mode-standalone``
-------------------------

This is the default build mode. It is enabled by default.

This build mode uses default Python linking behavior and feature detection
as implemented by the ``pyo3``. It will attempt to find a ``python`` in
``PATH`` or from the ``PYO3_PYTHON`` environment variable and link against it.

This is the default mode for convenience, as it enables the ``pyembed`` crate
to build in the most environments. However, the built binaries will have a
dependency against a foreign ``libpython`` and likely aren't suitable for
distribution.

This mode does not attempt to invoke ``pyoxidizer`` or find artifacts it would
have built. It is possible to build the ``pyembed`` crate in this mode if
the ``pyo3`` crate can find a Python interpreter. But, the ``pyembed``
crate may not be usable or work in the way you want it to.

This mode is intended to be used for performing quick testing on the
``pyembed`` crate. It is quite possible that linking errors will occur
in this mode unless you take additional actions to point Cargo at
appropriate libraries.

``pyembed`` has a dependency on Python 3.8+. If an older Python is detected,
it can result in build errors, including unresolved symbol errors.

``build-mode-pyoxidizer-exe``
-----------------------------

A ``pyoxidizer`` executable will be run to generate build artifacts.

The path to this executable can be defined via the ``PYOXIDIZER_EXE``
environment variable. Otherwise ``PATH`` will be used.

At build time, ``pyoxidizer run-build-script`` will be run. A
``PyOxidizer`` configuration file will be discovered using PyOxidizer's
heuristics for doing so. ``OUT_DIR`` will be set if running from ``cargo``,
so a ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` next to the main Rust project being built should
be found and used.

``pyoxidizer run-build-script`` will resolve the default build script target
by default. To override which target should be resolved, specify the target
name via the ``PYOXIDIZER_BUILD_TARGET`` environment variable. e.g.::

   $ PYOXIDIZER_BUILD_TARGET=build-artifacts cargo build

``build-mode-prebuilt-artifacts``
---------------------------------

This mode tells the build script to reuse artifacts that were already built.
(Perhaps you called ``pyoxidizer build`` or ``pyoxidizer run-build-script``
outside the context of a normal ``cargo build``.) This is what is used when pyoxidizer invokes cargo as part of ``pyoxidizer build``.

In this mode, the build script will look for artifacts in the directory
specified by ``PYOXIDIZER_ARTIFACT_DIR`` if set, falling back to ``OUT_DIR``.

``global-allocator-jemalloc``
-----------------------------

This feature will configure the Rust global allocator to use ``jemalloc``.

``global-allocator-mimalloc``
-----------------------------

This feature will configure the Rust global allocator to use ``mimalloc``.

``global-allocator-snmalloc``
-----------------------------

This feature will configure the Rust global allocator to use ``snmalloc``.

``allocator-jemalloc``
----------------------

This configures the ``pyembed`` crate with support for having the Python
interpreter use the ``jemalloc`` allocator.

``allocator-mimalloc``
----------------------

This configures the ``pyembed`` crate with support for having the Python
interpreter use the ``mimalloc`` allocator.

``allocator-snmalloc``
----------------------

This configures the ``pyembed`` crate with support for having the Python
interpreter use the ``snmalloc`` allocator.

Using Cargo With Generated Rust Projects
========================================

Building a PyOxidizer-enabled Rust project with ``cargo`` is not as turn-key
as it is with ``pyoxidizer``.  That's because PyOxidizer has to do some
non-conventional things to get Rust projects to build in very specific ways.
Commands like ``pyoxidizer build`` abstract away all of this complexity for you.

If you do want to use ``cargo`` directly, the following sections will give you
some tips.

Linking Against Python
----------------------

Autogenerated Rust projects need to link against Python. The link settings
are ultimately derived from the ``pyo3-build-config`` crate via the dependency
on ``pyo3`` in the ``pyembed`` crate. (``pyembed`` is part of the PyOxidizer
project.)

See :ref:`pyembed_building` for documentation on how to configure the
Python linking settings of the ``pyembed`` crate.

.. important::

   If you don't set environment variables to point ``pyembed``/``pyo3`` at a
   custom Python, Python won't be linked into your binary the way that
   ``pyoxidizer build`` would link it.

For best results, you'll want to use a Python library built the same
way that PyOxidizer builds it. The
``pyoxidizer generate-python-embedding-artifacts`` command can be used to
produce such a library along with a PyO3 configuration file for linking it.
See :ref:`pyoxidizer_rust_generic_embedding` for details.

Cargo Configuration
-------------------

Linking a custom libpython into the final Rust binary can be finicky, especially
when statically linking on Windows.

The auto-generated ``.cargo/config`` file defines some custom compiler settings
to enable things to work. However, this only works for some configurations. The
file contains some commented out settings that may need to be set for some
configurations (e.g. the ``standalone_static`` Windows distributions).

Please consult this file if running into build errors when not building through
``pyoxidizer``.

Also consider porting these linker settings to your own crate.

Building with Cargo and PyOxidizer
==================================

It is possible to use ``cargo`` to drive builds but still invoke ``pyoxidizer``
as part of the build. This is an advanced workflow that hasn't been optimized
for ergonomics and it requires setting many environment variables to get things
to play together nicely.

This is essentially a 2 step process:

1. Generate build artifacts consumed by the ``pyembed`` and ``pyo3`` crates.
2. Build with ``cargo``.

Starting from a project freshly created with ``pyoxidizer init-rust-project sample``,
you'll first need to generate required build artifacts::

   $ CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR=. \
     TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
     PROFILE=debug \
     OUT_DIR=target/out \
     pyoxidizer run-build-script build.rs

This command will evaluate your PyOxidizer configuration file and write output
files. The environment variables simulate the Cargo environment from which this
command is usually called.

If all works correctly, build artifacts will be written to ``target/out``.

Then you can run ``cargo`` to build your crate, consuming the built artifacts::

   $ PYOXIDIZER_ARTIFACT_DIR=$(pwd)/target/out \
     PYO3_CONFIG_FILE=$(pwd)/target/out/pyo3-build-config-file.txt \
     cargo build \
       --no-default-features \
       --features "build-mode-prebuilt-artifacts global-allocator-jemalloc allocator-jemalloc"

After building, you should find an executable in ``target/debug/``.

.. note::

   On Windows, you should remove the features referencing ``jemalloc``, as
   this feature isn't available on Windows.

.. important::

   When building through ``cargo``, additional files are not copied into place
   next to the built crate. This can include required shared libraries,
   extension modules, and even the Python standard library. This can result
   in the embedded Python interpreter not working correctly.

   You may need to manually copy additional files for the built binary to work
   as expected. The easiest way to do this is to build your project with
   ``pyoxidizer build`` and copy the files from its output.
