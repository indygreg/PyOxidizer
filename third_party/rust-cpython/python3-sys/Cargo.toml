# so that the module can also be used with statically linked python interpreters.
extension-module = [ ]

# This feature implies default linking behavior.
#
# If not an extension module or on Windows, the crate will link against
# pythonXY where XY is derived from the discovered Python version. The link
# type will be static, shared, or framework depending on the discovered Python.
#
# The path to pythonXY from the discovered Python install may also be
# added to the linker search path.
link-mode-default = []

# This feature forces Python symbols to be unresolved by emitting a
# `rustc-link-lib=static-nobundle=python37` directive on Windows (which
# is the only platform where it makes sense).
#
# This mode is useful for scenarios where you want another crate to emit
# the linker directives that define the location of a static Python library.
#
# This mode is typically not needed, as Python distributions on Windows
# rarely use a static Python library.
