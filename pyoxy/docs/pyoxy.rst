===========================
The ``PyOxy`` Python Runner
===========================

PyOxy is a Python runner. Think of it as an alternative implementation
and re-imagination of the ubiquitous ``python`` command, but providing more
features and control than ``python``.

The ``Py`` part of ``PyOxy`` refers to Python and the ``Oxy`` a reference to
*oxidiation*, as PyOxy is implemented in Rust. PyOxy is also part of the
PyOxidizer project, leveraging much of its *technology*.
