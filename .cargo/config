# This configuration is copied from pyembed/.cargo/conf. See it for the
# rationale.
#
# The reason we have two copies is so `cargo` invocations from the workspace
# pick up these configs. Without them, we don't export symbols from generated
# binaries. And in the case of the pyembed crate, that means we can't run unit
# tests. This does mean that we will export symbols for other binaries in the
# workspace. This likely isn't desired. So packaging and releasing should invoke
# cargo outside of the workspace to prevent this behavior.
