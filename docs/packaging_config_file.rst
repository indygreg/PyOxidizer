Packaging Primitives in ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` Files
================================================

PyOxidizer's run-time behavior is controlled by ``pyoxidizer.bzl``
Starlark (a Python-like language) configuration files. See :ref:`config_files`
for documentation on these files, including low-level API documentation.

This document gives a medium-level overview of the important Starlark
types and functions and how they all interact.

Targets Define Actions
======================

As detailed at :ref:`config_processing_targets`, a PyOxidizer configuration
file is composed of named *targets*, which are functions returning an object
that may have a build or run action attached. Commands like
``pyoxidizer build`` identify a target to evaluate then effectively
walk the dependency graph evaluating dependent targets until the
requested target is *built*.

.. _packaging_config_type_python_executable:

Defining an Executable Embedding Python
=======================================

In this example, we create an executable embedding Python:

.. code-block:: python

   def make_dist():
       return default_python_distribution()

   def make_exe(dist):
       return dist.to_python_executable("myapp")

   register_target("dist", make_dist)
   register_target("exe", make_exe, depends=["dist"], default=True)

``PythonDistribution.to_python_executable()`` accepts an optional
``PythonPackagingPolicy`` instance that influences how the executable
is built and what resources are added where. See the
:ref:`type documentation <config_type_python_packaging_policy>` for the
list of parameters that can be influenced. Some of this behavior
is described in the sections below. Other examples are provided
throughout the :ref:`packaging` documentation.

.. _packaging_config_interpreter_config:

Configuring the Python Interpreter Run-Time Behavior
====================================================

The :ref:`config_type_python_interpreter_config`
Starlark type configures the default behavior of the Python interpreter
embedded in built binaries.

A ``PythonInterpreterConfig`` instance is associated with ``PythonExecutable``
instances when they are created. A custom instance can be passed into
``PythonDistribution.to_python_executable()`` to use non-default settings.

In this example (similar to above), we construct a custom
``PythonInterpreterConfig`` instance using non-defaults and then pass
this instance into the constructed ``PythonExecutable``:

.. code-block:: python

   def make_dist():
       return default_python_distribution()

   def make_exe(dist):
       config = dist.make_python_interpreter_config()
       config.run_command = "print('hello, world')"

       return dist.to_python_executable("myapp", config=config)

   register_target("dist", make_dist)
   register_target("exe", make_exe, depends=["dist"], default=True)

The ``PythonInterpreterConfig`` type exposes a lot of modifiable settings.
See the :ref:`API documentation <config_type_python_interpreter_config>` for
the complete list. These settings include but are not limited to:

* Control of low-level Python interpreter settings, such as whether
  environment variables (like ``PYTHONPATH``) should influence run-time
  behavior, whether stdio should be buffered, and the filesystem encoding
  to use.
* Whether to enable the importing of Python modules from the filesystem
  and what the initial value of ``sys.path`` should be.
* The memory allocator that the Python interpreter should use.
* What Python code to run when the interpreter is started.
* How the ``terminfo`` database should be located.

Many of these settings are not needed for most programs and the defaults
are meant to be reasonable for most programs. However, some settings - such
as the ``run_*`` arguments defining what Python code to run by default - are
required by most configuration files.

.. _packaging_config_python_packages:

Adding Python Packages to Executables
=====================================

A just-created ``PythonExecutable`` Starlark type contains just the
Python interpreter and standard library derived from the ``PythonDistribution``
from which it came. While you can use PyOxidizer to produce an executable
containing just a normal Python *distribution* with nothing else, many people
will want to add their own Python packages/code.

The Starlark environment defines various types for representing Python
package resources. These include
:ref:`config_type_python_module_source`,
:ref:`config_type_python_extension_module`,
:ref:`config_type_python_package_distribution_resource`,
and more.

Instances of these types can be created dynamically or by performing
common Python packaging operations (such as invoking ``pip install``) via
various methods on ``PythonExecutable`` instances. These Python package
resource instances can then be added to ``PythonExecutable`` instances
so they are part of the built binary.

See :ref:`packaging_resources` and :ref:`packaging_python_files`
for more on this topic, including many examples.

.. _packaging_config_install_manifests:

Install Manifests Copy Files Next to Your Application
=====================================================

The :ref:`config_type_file_manifest` Starlark type represents a
collection of files and their content. When ``FileManifest`` instances are
returned from a target function, their build action results in their contents
being manifested in a directory having the name of the build target.

``FileManifest`` instances can be used to construct custom file *install
layouts*.

Say you have an existing directory tree of files you want to copy
next to your built executable defined by the ``PythonExecutable`` type.

The :ref:`glob() <config_glob>` function can be used to discover existing
files on the filesystem and turn them into a ``FileManifest``. You can then
return this ``FileManifest`` directory or overlay it onto another
instance using :ref:`config_file_manifest_add_manifest`. Here's an
example:

.. code-block:: python

   def make_dist():
       return default_python_distribution()

   def make_exe(dist):
       return dist.to_python_executable("myapp")

   def make_install(exe):
       m = FileManifest()

       m.add_python_resource(".", exe)

       templates = glob(["/path/to/project/templates/**/*"], strip_prefix="/path/to/project/")
       m.add_manifest(templates)

       return m

   register_target("dist", make_dist)
   register_target("exe", make_exe, depends=["dist"])
   register_target("install", make_install, depends=["exe"], default=True)

We introduce a new ``install`` target and ``make_install()`` function which
returns a ``FileManifest``. It adds the ``PythonExecutable`` (represented
by the ``exe`` argument/variable) to that manifest in the root directory,
signified by ``.``.

Next, it calls ``glob()`` to find all files in the
``/path/to/project/templates/`` directory tree, strips the path prefix
``/path/to/project/`` from them, and then merges all of these files into
the final manifest.

When the ``InstallManifest`` is built, the final layout should look something
like the following:

* ``install/myapp`` (or ``install/myapp.exe`` on Windows)
* ``install/templates/foo``
* ``install/templates/...``

See :ref:`packaging_additional_files` for more on this topic.
