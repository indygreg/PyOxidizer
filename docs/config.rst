.. _config_files:

===================
Configuration Files
===================

PyOxidizer uses `Starlark <https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark>`_
files to configure run-time behavior. Starlark is a dialect of Python
intended to be used as a configuration language and the syntax should
be rather obvious to any Python programmer.

Finding Configuration Files
===========================

The Starlark configuration file is processed as part of building the ``pyembed``
crate. This is the crate that manages an embedded Python interpreter in a
larger Rust project.

If the ``PYOXIDIZER_CONFIG`` environment variable is set, the path specified
by this environment variable will be used as the location of the Starlark
configuration file.

If ``PYOXIDIZER_CONFIG`` is not set, the build will look for a
``pyoxidizer.bzl`` file starting in the directory of the ``pyembed``
crate and then traversing ancestor directories until a file is found.

If no configuration file is found, an error occurs.

File Processing Semantics
=========================

A configuration file is evaluated in a custom Starlark *dialect* which
provides primitives used by PyOxidizer. This dialect provides some
well-defined global variables (defined in UPPERCASE) as well as some
types and functions that can be constructed and called.

A configuration file is effectively a sandboxed Python script. While
many configuration files will be mostly static, it is possible for
configuration files to dynamically determine what actions to take based
on global variables, etc. This means there typically only needs to be a
single configuration file rather than a variant for each build configuration.

Global Environment
==================

The evaluation context takes place in a *global environment*.

This environment contains
`built-in symbols and constants from Starlark <https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md#built-in-constants-and-functions>`_
in addition to symbols and constants provided by PyOxidizer. The
following sections describe those symbols.

Global Constants
================

PyOxidizer provides global constants as defined by the following sections.

BUILD_TARGET
------------

The string Rust target triple that we're currently building for. Will be
a value like ``x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`` or ``x86_64-pc-windows-msvc``.
Run ``rustup target list`` to see a list of targets.

CONFIG_PATH
-----------

The string path to the configuration file currently being evaluated.

CONTEXT
-------

Holds build context. This is an internal variable and accessing it will
not provide any value.

CWD
---

The current working directory. Also the directory containing the active
configuration file.

Global Symbols
==============

PyOxidizer defines various global symbols to define execution
behavior. These are explained in the following sections.

.. _config_build:

``BuildConfig(application_name, build_path=None)``
--------------------------------------------------

This type configured high-level application build settings. It
accepts the following arguments:

``application_name``
   Name of the application being built.

   This also corresponds to the name of the Rust binary to be built.
   A ``cargo build --bin <application_name>`` must work.

``build_path``
   Filesystem path to directory where build artifacts will be written.

   Build artifacts include Rust build state, files generated by PyOxidizer,
   staging areas for built binaries, etc.

   The special value ``$ORIGIN`` will be replaced by the directory
   holding this configuration file.

   The default value is ``$ORIGIN/build``.

.. _config_python_distribution:

``PythonDistribution(sha256, local_path=None, url=None)``
---------------------------------------------------------

Defines a Python distribution that can be embedded into a binary.

A Python distribution is a zstandard-compressed tar archive containing a
specially produced build of Python. These distributions are typically
produced by the
`python-build-standalone <https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone>`_
project. Pre-built distributions are available at
https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases.

A distribution is defined by a location, and a hash.

One of ``local_path`` or ``url`` MUST be defined.

``sha256`` (string)
   The SHA-256 of the distribution archive file.

``local_path`` (string)
   Local filesystem path to the distribution archive.

``url`` (string)
   URL from which a distribution archive can be obtained using an HTTP GET
   request.

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

   linux = PythonDistribution(
       sha256="11a53f5755773f91111a04f6070a6bc00518a0e8e64d90f58584abf02ca79081",
       local_path="/var/python-distributions/cpython-linux64.tar.zst"
   )

   macos = PythonDistribution(
        sha256="b46a861c05cb74b5b668d2ce44dcb65a449b9fef98ba5d9ec6ff6937829d5eec",
        url="https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20190505/cpython-3.7.3-macos-20190506T0054.tar.zst"
   )

``default_python_distribution(build_target=None)``
--------------------------------------------------

Resolves the default ``PythonDistribution`` for the given build target,
which defaults to the active build target as defined by ``BUILD_TARGET``.

The ``pyoxidizer`` binary has a set of known distributions built-in
which are automatically available and used by default in autogenerated
config files. Typically you don't need to build your own distribution or
change the distribution manually: distributions are managed automatically
by ``pyoxidizer``.

.. _config_embedded_python_config:

``EmbeddedPythonConfig(...)```
------------------------------

This type configures the default behavior of the embedded Python interpreter.

Embedded Python interpreters are configured and instantiated using a
``pyembed::PythonConfig`` data structure. The ``pyembed`` crate defines a
default instance of this data structure with parameters defined by the settings
in this type.

.. note::

   If you are writing custom Rust code and constructing a custom
   ``pyembed::PythonConfig`` instance and don't use the default instance, this
   config type is not relevant to you and can be omitted from your config
   file.

The following arguments can be defined to control the default ``PythonConfig``
behavior:

``dont_write_bytecode`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_DontWriteBytecodeFlag <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_DontWriteBytecodeFlag>`_.

   This is only relevant if the interpreter is configured to import modules
   from the filesystem.

   Default is ``True``.

``ignore_environment`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_IgnoreEnvironmentFlag>`_.

   This is likely wanted for embedded applications that don't behave like
   ``python`` executables.

   Default is ``True``.

``no_site`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_NoSiteFlag <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_NoSiteFlag>`_.

   The ``site`` module is typically not needed for standalone Python applications.

   Default is ``True``.

``no_user_site_directory`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_NoUserSiteDirectory <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_NoUserSiteDirectory>`_.

   Default is ``True``.

``optimize_level`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_OptimizeFlag <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_OptimizeFlag>`_.

   Default is ``0``, which is the Python default. Only the values ``0``, ``1``,
   and ``2`` are accepted.

   This setting is only relevant if ``dont_write_bytecode`` is ``false`` and Python
   modules are being imported from the filesystem.

``stdio_encoding`` (string)
   Defines the encoding and error handling mode for Python's standard I/O
   streams (``sys.stdout``, etc). Values are of the form ``encoding:error`` e.g.
   ``utf-8:ignore`` or ``latin1-strict``.

   If defined, the ``Py_SetStandardStreamEncoding()`` function is called during
   Python interpreter initialization. If not, the Python defaults are used.

``unbuffered_stdio`` (bool)
   Controls the value of
   `Py_UnbufferedStdioFlag <https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/init.html#c.Py_UnbufferedStdioFlag>`_.

   Setting this makes the standard I/O streams unbuffered.

   Default is ``False``.

``filesystem_importer`` (bool)
   Controls whether to enable Python's filesystem based importer. Enabling
   this importer allows Python modules to be imported from the filesystem.

   Default is ``False`` (since PyOxidizer prefers embedding Python modules in
   binaries).

``sys_frozen`` (bool)
   Controls whether to set the ``sys.frozen`` attribute to ``True``. If
   ``false``, ``sys.frozen`` is not set.

   Default is ``False``.

``sys_meipass`` (bool)
   Controls whether to set the ``sys._MEIPASS`` attribute to the path of
   the executable.

   Setting this and ``sys_frozen`` to ``true`` will emulate the
   `behavior of PyInstaller <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/v3.3.1/runtime-information.html>`_
   and could possibly help self-contained applications that are aware of
   PyInstaller also work with PyOxidizer.

   Default is ``False``.

``sys_paths`` (array of strings)
   Defines filesystem paths to be added to ``sys.path``.

   Setting this value will imply ``filesystem_importer = true``.

   The special token ``$ORIGIN`` in values will be expanded to the absolute
   path of the directory of the executable at run-time. For example,
   if the executable is ``/opt/my-application/pyapp``, ``$ORIGIN`` will
   expand to ``/opt/my-application`` and the value ``$ORIGIN/lib`` will
   expand to ``/opt/my-application/lib``.

   If defined in multiple sections, new values completely overwrite old
   values (values are not merged).

   Default is an empty array (``[]``).

``raw_allocator`` (string)
   Which memory allocator to use for the ``PYMEM_DOMAIN_RAW`` allocator.

   This controls the lowest level memory allocator used by Python. All Python
   memory allocations use memory allocated by this allocator (higher-level
   allocators call into this pool to allocate large blocks then allocate
   memory out of those blocks instead of using the *raw* memory allocator).

   Values can be ``jemalloc``, ``rust``, or ``system``.

   ``jemalloc`` will have Python use the jemalloc allocator directly.

   ``rust`` will use Rust's global allocator (whatever that may be).

   ``system`` will use the default allocator functions exposed to the binary
   (``malloc()``, ``free()``, etc).

   The ``jemalloc`` allocator requires the ``jemalloc-sys`` crate to be
   available. A run-time error will occur if ``jemalloc`` is configured but this
   allocator isn't available.

   **Important**: the ``rust`` crate is not recommended because it introduces
   performance overhead.

   Default is ``jemalloc`` on non-Windows targets and ``system`` on Windows.
   (The ``jemalloc-sys`` crate doesn't work on Windows MSVC targets.)

.. _config_terminfo_resolution:

``terminfo_resolution`` (string)
   How the terminal information database (``terminfo``) should be configured.

   See :ref:`terminfo_database` for more about terminal databases.

   The value ``dynamic`` (the default) looks at the currently running
   operating system and attempts to do something reasonable. For example, on
   Debian based distributions, it will look for the ``terminfo`` database in
   ``/etc/terminfo``, ``/lib/terminfo``, and ``/usr/share/terminfo``, which is
   how Debian configures ``ncurses`` to behave normally. Similar behavior exists
   for other recognized operating systems. If the operating system is unknown,
   PyOxidizer falls back to looking for the ``terminfo`` database in well-known
   directories that often contain the database (like ``/usr/share/terminfo``).

   The value ``none`` indicates that no configuration of the ``terminfo``
   database path should be performed. This is useful for applications that
   don't interact with terminals. Using ``none`` can prevent some filesystem
   I/O at application startup.

   The value ``static`` indicates that a static path should be used for the
   path to the ``terminfo`` database. That path should be provided by the
   ``terminfo_dirs`` configuration option.

   ``terminfo`` is not used on Windows and this setting is ignored on that
   platform.

``terminfo_dirs``
   Path to the ``terminfo`` database. See the above documentation for
   ``terminfo_resolution`` for more on the ``terminfo`` database.

   This value consists of a ``:`` delimited list of filesystem paths that
   ``ncurses`` should be configured to use. This value will be used to
   populate the ``TERMINFO_DIRS`` environment variable at application run time.

``write_modules_directory_env`` (string)
   Environment variable that defines a directory where ``modules-<UUID>`` files
   containing a ``\n`` delimited list of loaded Python modules (from ``sys.modules``)
   will be written upon interpreter shutdown.

   If this setting is not defined or if the environment variable specified by its
   value is not present at run-time, no special behavior will occur. Otherwise,
   the environment variable's value is interpreted as a directory, that directory
   and any of its parents will be created, and a ``modules-<UUID>`` file will
   be written to the directory.

   This setting is useful for determining which Python modules are loaded when
   running Python code.

.. _config_embedded_python_run:

Python Run Mode
---------------

Embedded Python interpreters are configured and instantiated using a
``pyembed::PythonConfig`` data structure. The ``pyembed`` crate defines a
default instance of this data structure with parameters defined by a
``PythonRunMode`` instance.

.. note::

   If you are writing custom Rust code and constructing a custom
   ``pyembed::PythonConfig`` instance and don't use the default instance, this
   config section is not relevant to you and can be omitted from your config
   file.

The sections below denote ways of constructing ``PythonRunMode``
instances.

``python_run_mode_eval(code)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mode will evaluate a string containing Python code after the
interpreter initializes.

This mode requires the ``code`` argument to be set to a string containing
Python code to run.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   python_run_mode = python_run_mode_eval("import mymodule; mymodule.main()")

``python_run_mode_module(module)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mode will load a named Python module as the ``__main__`` module and
then execute that module.

This mode requires the ``module`` argument to be set to the string value of
the module to load as ``__main__``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   python_run_mode = python_run_mode_module("mymodule")

``python_run_mode_repl()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mode will launch an interactive Python REPL connected to stdin. This
is similar to the behavior of running a ``python`` executable without any
arguments.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   python_run_mode = python_run_mode_repl()

``python_run_mode_noop()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This mode will do nothing. It is provided for completeness sake.

.. _config_packaging_rule:

Packaging Rules
---------------

There exist several types to control packaging of the built application.
These types are constructed and then passed into and evaluated sequentially
as part of building the application.

Packaging rules operate in the domain of Python resources.

A *Python resource* can be one of the following:

* *Extension module*. An extension module is a Python module backed by compiled
  code (typically written in C).
* *Python module source*. A Python module's source code. This is typically the
  content of a ``.py`` file.
* *Python module bytecode*. A Python module's source compiled to Python
  bytecode. This is similar to a ``.pyc`` files but isn't exactly the same
  (``.pyc`` files have a header in addition to the raw bytecode).
* *Resource file*. Non-module files that can be accessed via APIs in Python's
  importing mechanism.

*Extension modules* are a bit special in that they can have library
dependencies. If an extension module has an annotated library dependency,
that library will automatically be linked into the produced binary containing
Python. Static linking is used, if available. For example, the ``_sqlite3``
extension module will link the ``libsqlite3`` library (which should be
included as part of the Python distribution).

Each rule denotes special behavior for finding and including or excluding
resources.

When packaging goes to resolve the set of resources, it starts with an
empty set for each resource *flavor*. As rules are read, their results are
*merged* with the existing resource sets according to the behavior of that
rule ``type``. If multiple rules add a resource of the same name and flavor, the
last added version is used. i.e. *last write wins*.

.. _install_locations:

Install Locations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some rules support the concept of *install locations*. This allows resources
to be packaged in different locations. For example, some resources can be
embedded in the produced binary and others can live as files on the
filesystem (like how Python traditionally works).

If a rule supports *install locations*, the string value defining an install
location has the following values:

``embedded``
   Resource will be embedded in the produced binary.

   This is usually the default install location.

``app-relative:<path>``
   Strings prefixed with ``app-relative:`` denote a path relative to the
   produced binary. The value following the prefix will be joined with the
   parent directory of the produced binary to form a base path for resources
   to be installed into.

   For example, ``app-relative:lib`` would install resources into a ``lib``
   child directory underneath where the produced binary lives.

   Different resource types are mapped to different semantics for choosing the
   exact final path. Using the above example, a Python source module for the
   ``foo.bar`` module would be installed to ``lib/foo/bar.py`` or
   ``lib/foo/bar/__init__.py`` if it is a package module.

The following sections describe the various ``type``'s of rules.

``StdlibExtensionsPolicy(policy)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule defines a base policy for what *extension modules* to include
from the Python distribution.

This type has a ``policy`` argument denoting the *policy* to use. This can
have the following values:

``minimal``
   Include the minimal set of extension modules required to initialize a
   Python interpreter. This is a very small set and various common
   functionality from the Python standard library will not work with this
   value.

``all``
   Includes all available extension modules in the Python distribution.

``no-libraries``
   Includes all available extension modules in the Python distribution that
   do not have an additional library dependency. Most common Python extension
   modules are included. Extension modules like ``_ssl`` (links against
   OpenSSL) and ``zlib`` are not included.

``no-gpl``
   Includes all available extension modules in the Python distribution that
   do not link against GPL licensed libraries.

   Not all Python distributions may annotate license info for all extensions or
   the libraries they link against. If license info is missing, the extension is
   not included because it *could* be GPL licensed. Similarly, the mechanism for
   determining whether a license is GPL is based on an explicit list of non-GPL
   licenses. This ensures new GPL licenses don't slip through.

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

   stdlib_extensions_policy = StdlibExtensionsPolicy("no-libraries")

.. important::

   Libraries that extension modules link against have various software
   licenses, including GPL version 3. Adding these extension modules will
   also include the library. This typically exposes your program to additional
   licensing requirements, including making your application subject to that
   license and therefore open source. See :ref:`licensing_considerations` for
   more.

``StdlibExtensionsExplicitIncludes(includes)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule allows including explicitly delimited extension modules from
the Python distribution.

The rule must define an ``includes`` argument, which is an array of strings
of extension module names.

This policy is typically combined with the ``minimal`` ``stdlib-extension-policy``
to cherry pick individual extension modules for inclusion.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   StdlibExtensionsExplicitIncludes(["binascii", "errno", "itertools", "math", "select", "_socket"])

``StdlibExtensionsExplicitExcludes(excludes)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule allows excluding explicitly delimited extension modules from
the Python distribution.

The rule must define an ``excludes`` argument, which is an array of strings of
extension module names.

Every known extension module not in ``excludes`` will be added. If an extension
module with a name in ``excludes`` has already been added, it will be removed.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   StdlibExtensionsExplicitExcludes(["_ssl"])

``StdlibExtensionVariant(extension, variant)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule specifies the inclusion of a specific extension module *variant*.

Some Python distributions offer multiple variants for an individual extension
module. For example, the ``readline`` extension module may offer a ``libedit``
variant that is compiled against ``libedit`` instead of ``libreadline`` (the default).

By default, the first listed extension module variant in a Python distribution
is used. By defining rules of this type, one can use an alternate or explicit
extension module variation.

Extension module variants are defined via the ``extension`` and ``variant``
arguments. The former defines the extension module name. The latter its
variant name.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   StdlibExtensionVariant("readline", "libedit")

``Stdlib(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule controls packaging of non-extension modules Python resources from
the Python distribution's standard library. Presence of this rule will
pull in the Python standard library in its entirety.

.. important::

   A ``Stdlib`` rule is required, as Python can't be initialized
   without some modules from the standard library. It should be one of the first
   packaging rule entries so the standard library forms the base of the
   set of Python modules to include.

The following arguments control behavior:

``exclude_test_modules`` (bool)
   Indicates whether test-only modules should be included in packaging. The
   Python standard library ships various packages and modules that are used for
   testing Python itself. These modules are not referenced by *real* modules
   in the Python standard library and can usually be safely excluded.

   Default is ``True``.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The optimization level for packaged bytecode. Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and
   ``2``.

   Default is ``0``, which is the Python default.

``excludes`` (array of string)
   An array of module names to exclude.

   A value in this array will match on an exact full resource name match or
   on a package prefix match. e.g. ``foo`` will match the module ``foo``, the
   package ``foo``, and any sub-modules in ``foo``. e.g. it will match
   ``foo.bar`` but will not match ``foofoo``.

   Default is an empty array.

``include_source`` (bool)
   Whether to include the source code for modules in addition to bytecode.

   Default is ``True``.

``include_resources`` (bool)
   Whether to include non-module resource files.

   These are files like ``lib2to3/Grammar.txt`` which are present in the
   standard library but aren't typically used for common functionality.

   Default is ``False``.

``install_location`` (string)
   Where to package these resources. See :ref:`install_locations`.

``PackageRoot(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule discovers resources from a directory on the filesystem.

The specified directory will be scanned for resource files. However,
only specific named *packages* will be packaged. e.g. if the directory
contains sub-directories ``foo/`` and ``bar``, you must explicitly
state that you want the ``foo`` and/or ``bar`` package to be included so files
from these directories will be included.

This rule is frequently used to pull in packages from local source
directories (e.g. directories containing a ``setup.py`` file). This
rule doesn't involve any packaging tools and is a purely driven by
filesystem walking. It is primitive, yet effective.

This rule has the following arguments:

``path`` (string)
   The filesystem path to the directory to scan.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The module optimization level for packaged bytecode.

   Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

   Defaults to ``0``, which is the Python default.

``packages`` (array of string)
   List of package names to include.

   Filesystem walking will find files in a directory ``<path>/<value>/`` or in
   a file ``<path>/<value>.py``.

``excludes`` (array of string)
   An array of package or module names to exclude.

   A value in this array will match on an exact full resource name match or
   on a package prefix match. e.g. ``foo`` will match the module ``foo``, the
   package ``foo``, and any sub-modules in ``foo``. e.g. it will match
   ``foo.bar`` but will not match ``foofoo``.

   Default is an empty array.

``include_source`` (bool)
   Whether to include the source code for modules in addition to the bytecode.

   Default is ``True``.

``install_location`` (string)
   Where to package resources associated with this rule.
   See :ref:`install_locations`.

``PipInstallSimple(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule runs ``pip install`` for a single package and will automatically
package all Python resources associated with that operation, including
resources associated with dependencies.

Using this rule, one can easily add multiple Python packages with a single
rule.

``package`` (string)
   Name of the package to install. This is added as a positional argument to
   ``pip install``.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The module optimization level for packaged bytecode.

   Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

   Default is ``0``, which is the Python default.

``include_source`` (bool)
   Whether to include the source code for Python modules in addition to
   the byte code.

   Default is ``True``.

``excludes`` (array of string)
   An array of package or module names to exclude. See the documentation
   for ``excludes`` for ``package-root`` rules for more.

   Default is an empty array.

``install_location`` (string)
   Where to package resources associated with this rule.
   See :ref:`install_locations`.

``extra_args`` (optional array of string)
   An array of arguments added to the pip install command.

This will include the ``pyflakes`` package and all its dependencies as embedded
resources:

.. code-block:: python

   PipInstallSimple(package="pyflakes")

This will include the ``black`` package and all its dependencies in a directory
next to the produced binary:

.. code-block:: python

   PipInstallSimple(package="black", install_location="app-relative:lib")

``PipRequirementsFile(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule runs ``pip install -r <path>`` for a given
`pip requirements file <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>`_.
This allows multiple Python packages to be downloaded/installed in a single
operation.

``requirements_path`` (string)
   Filesystem path to pip requirements file.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The module optimization level for packaged bytecode.

   Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

   Defaults to ``0``, which is the Python default.

``include_source`` (bool)
   Whether to include the source code for Python modules in addition to the
   bytecode.

   Default is ``True``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   PipRequirementsFile(requirements_path="/home/gps/src/myapp/requirements.txt")

``SetupPyInstall(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule runs ``python setup.py install`` for a given directory containing a
``setup.py`` ``distutils``/``setuptools`` packaging script.

The target package will be installed to a temporary directory and its installed
resources will be collected and packaged.

``package_path`` (string)
   Local filesystem to the directory containing a ``setup.py`` file.

   Can be a relative or absolute path. If relative, it is evaluated relative
   to the PyOxidizer configuration file.

   The ``setup.py`` invocation will run with its current working directory set
   to this path.

``extra_env`` (dict)
   Extra environment variables to pass to the ``setup.py`` invocation.

   Some ``setup.py`` scripts accept environment variables to customize execution
   behavior. This option can be defined to pass those along to the invocation.

``extra_global_arguments`` (array of string)
   Extra arguments to pass to ``setup.py`` before the ``install`` command.

   Some ``setup.py`` scripts accept global arguments to control how the
   distribution is installed. This option can be defined to specify additional
   process arguments to the ``setup.py`` command.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The module optimization level for packaged bytecode.

   Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

   Defaults to ``0``, which is the Python default.

``include_source`` (bool)
   Whether to include the source code for Python modules in addition to the
   bytecode.

   Default is ``True``.

``install_location`` (string)
   Where to package resources associated with this rule.
   See :ref:`install_locations`.

``excludes`` (array of string)
   An array of package or module names to exclude. See the documentation
   for ``excludes`` for ``package-root`` rules for more.

   Default is an empty array.

``Virtualenv(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule will include resources found in a pre-populated *virtualenv*
directory.

.. important::

   PyOxidizer only supports finding modules and resources
   populated via *traditional* means (e.g. ``pip install`` or ``python setup.py
   install``). If ``.pth`` or similar mechanisms are used for installing modules,
   files may not be discovered properly.

``path`` (string)
   The filesystem path to the root of the virtualenv.

   Python modules are typically in a ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`` directory
   (on UNIX) or ``Lib/site-packages`` directory (on Windows) under this path.

``optimize_level`` (int)
   The module optimization level for packaged bytecode.

   Allowed values are ``0``, ``1``, and ``2``.

   Defaults to ``0``, which is the Python default.

``excludes`` (array of string)
   An array of package or module names to exclude. See the documentation
   for ``excludes`` for ``package-root`` rules for more.

   Default is an empty array.

``include_source`` (bool)

   Whether to include the source code for modules in addition to the bytecode.

   Default is ``True``.

``install_location`` (string)
   Where to package resources associated with this rule.
   See :ref:`install_locations`.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   Virtualenv(path="/home/gps/src/myapp/venv")

``WriteLicenseFiles(path)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule instructs packaging to write license files to a directory as
denoted by this rule.

``path`` (string)
   Filesystem path to directory where licenses should be written.

   Value is relative to the application binary. An empty string denotes
   to write files in the same directory as the application binary.

.. _rule_filter-include:

``FilterInclude(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This rule filters all resource names resolved so far through a set of
resource names resolved from sources defined by this section. Resources
not contained in the set defined by this section will be removed.

This rule is effectively an *allow list*. This rule allows earlier rules
to aggressively pull in resources only to filter them via this rule.
This approach is often easier than adding a cherry picked set of resources
via highly granular addition rules.

The rule has arguments that define various sources for resource names:

``files`` (array of string)
   List of filesystem paths to files containing resource names. The file must
   be valid UTF-8 and consist of a ``\n`` delimited list of resource names.
   Empty lines and lines beginning with ``#`` are ignored.

``glob_files`` (array of string)
   List of glob matching patterns of filter files to read. ``*`` denotes
   all files in a directory. ``**`` denotes recursive directories. This uses
   the Rust ``glob`` crate under the hood and the documentation for that crate
   contains more pattern matching info.

   The files read by this argument must be the same format as documented by the
   ``files`` argument.

All defined arguments have their resolved resources combined into a set of
resource names. Each read entity has its values unioned with the set of
values resolved so far.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   FilterInclude(files=["allow-modules"], glob_files=["module-dumps/modules-*"])

.. _config_distribution:

Distributions
-------------

Instances of the ``Distribution`` type define application distributions
that can be produced. An application distribution is an entity that can be shared
across machines to *distribute* the application. Application distributions include
archives, installers, packages, etc.

Distributions can be constructed from types defined in the following sections.

``TarballDistribution(path_prefix=None)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This distribution will produce a tar archive from the contents of the
application directory.

This type accepts the following keys:

``path_prefix``
   String value that will be prepended to paths in the archive. By default,
   archive members have no path prefix and extraction of the archive will
   typically place files in the current directory. Specify this option to
   prefix all archive members with a path prefix.

``WixInstaller(...)``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This distribution will produce Windows installers via the
`WiX Toolset <https://wixtoolset.org/>`_. These installers allow the application
to be easily installed on Windows.

This type accepts the following arguments:

``msi_upgrade_code_x86``
   UUID to use for the x86 MSI installer. If not defined, a deterministic
   UUID based on the application name will be used.

``msi_upgrade_code_amd64``
   UUID to use for the x64 MSI installer. If not defined, a deterministic
   UUID based on the application name will be used.

``bundle_upgrade_code``
   UUID to use for the unified ``.exe`` bundle installer. The bundle installer
   contains the application's MSI installer as well as other dependencies (such
   as the Visual C++ Redistributable). This is typically the installer given to
   users.

   If not defined, a deterministic UUID based on the application name will be
   used.

``Config(...)``
---------------

This type defines the build configuration of an application. All the other types
in this file do nothing unless they are passed to a ``Config`` instance.

This type accepts the following arguments:

``build_config`` (``BuildConfig``)
   Defines the application build configuration.

``embedded_python_config`` (``EmbeddedPythonConfig``)
   Defines the default settings of the embedded Python interpreter.

``python_distribution`` (``PythonDistribution``)
   Defines the Python distribution to use to build the application.

``packaging_rules`` (list of packaging rules)
   Defines an ordered list of packaging rules to evaluate when building
   this application.

``python_run_mode`` (``PythonRunMode``)
   Defines the default Python execution behavior of the embedded Python
   interpreter.

``distributions`` (``Distribution``)
   Packaged distributions to build for this application.
