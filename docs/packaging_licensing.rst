Licensing Considerations
========================

Any time you link libraries together or distribute software, you need
to be concerned with the licenses of the underlying code. Some software
licenses - like the GPL - can require that any code linked with them be
subject to the license and therefore be made open source. In addition,
many licenses require a license and/or copyright notice be attached to
works that use or are derived from the project using that license. So
when building or distributing **any** software, you need to be cognizant
about all the software going into the final work and any licensing
terms that apply. Binaries produced with PyOxidizer are no different!

PyOxidizer and the code it uses in produced binaries is licensed under
the Mozilla Public License version 2.0. The licensing terms are
generally pretty favorable. (If the requirements are too strong, the
code that ships with binaries could potentially use a *weaker* license.
Get in touch with the project author.)

The Rust code PyOxidizer produces relies on a handful of 3rd party
Rust crates. These crates have various licenses. We recommend using
the `cargo-license <https://github.com/onur/cargo-license>`_,
`cargo-tree <https://github.com/sfackler/cargo-tree>`_, and
`cargo-lichking <https://github.com/Nemo157/cargo-lichking>`_ tools to
examine the Rust crate dependency tree and their respective licenses.
The ``cargo-lichking`` tool can even assemble licenses of Rust dependencies
automatically so you can more easily distribute those texts with your
application!

As cool as these Rust tools are, they don't include licenses for the
Python distribution, the libraries its extensions link against, nor any
3rd party Python packages you may have packaged.

Python and its various dependencies are governed by a handful of licenses.
These licenses have various requirements and restrictions.

At the very minimum, the binary produced with PyOxidizer will have a
Python distribution which is governed by a license. You will almost certainly
need to distribute a copy of this license with your application.

Various C-based extension modules part of Python's standard library
link against other C libraries. For self-contained Python binaries,
these libraries will be statically linked if they are present. That
can trigger *stronger* license protections. For example, if all
extension modules are present, the produced binary may contain a copy
of the GPL 3.0 licensed ``readline`` and ``gdbm`` libraries, thus triggering
strong copyleft protections in the GPL license.

.. important::

   It is critical to audit which Python extensions and packages are being
   packaged because of licensing requirements of various extensions.
   Consider using a package such as 
   `pip-licenses <https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses>`_ to
   generate a license report for your Python packages.

Showing Python Distribution Licenses
------------------------------------

The special Python distributions that PyOxidizer consumes can annotate
licenses of software within.

The ``pyoxidizer python-distribution-licenses`` command can display the
licenses for the Python distribution and libraries it may link against.
This command can be used to evaluate which extensions meet licensing
requirements and what licensing requirements apply if a given extension
or library is used.
