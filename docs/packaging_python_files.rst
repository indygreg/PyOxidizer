Packaging Python Files
======================

The most important packaged :ref:`resource type <packaging_resource_types>`
are arguably Python files: source modules, bytecode modules,
extension modules, package resources, etc.

For PyOxidizer to recognize these Python resources as Python resources
(as opposed to regular files), you will need to use the methods on the
:ref:`config_type_python_executable` Starlark type
to use the settings from the thing being built to scan for resources, possibly
performing a Python packaging action (such as invoking ``pip install``) along
the way.

This documentation covers the available methods and how they can be
used.

.. _packaging_python_executable_python_resource_methods:

``PythonExecutable`` Python Resources Methods
=============================================

The ``PythonExecutable`` Starlark type has the following methods that
can be called to perform an action and obtain an iterable of objects
representing discovered resources:

:ref:`pip_download(...) <config_python_executable_pip_download>`
   Invokes ``pip download`` with specified arguments and collects
   resources discovered from downloaded Python wheels.

:ref:`pip_install(...) <config_python_executable_pip_install>`
   Invokes ``pip install`` with specified arguments and collects all
   resources installed by that process.

:ref:`read_package_root(...) <config_python_executable_read_package_root>`
   Recursively scans a filesystem directory for Python resources in a
   typical Python installation layout.

:ref:`setup_py_install(...) <config_python_executable_setup_py_install>`
   Invokes ``python setup.py install`` for a given path and collects
   resources installed by that process.

:ref:`read_virtualenv(...) <config_python_executable_read_virtualenv>`
   Reads Python resources present in an already populated virtualenv.

Typically, the Starlark types resolved by these method calls are
passed into a method that adds the resource to a to-be-generated
entity, such as the :ref:`PythonExecutable <config_type_python_executable>`
Starlark type.

The following sections demonstrate common use cases.

.. _packaging_from_pypi_package:

Packaging an Application from a PyPI Package
============================================

In this section, we'll show how to package the
`pyflakes <https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/>`_ program using a published
PyPI package. (Pyflakes is a Python linter.)

First, let's create an empty project::

   $ pyoxidizer init-config-file pyflakes

Next, we need to edit the :ref:`configuration file <config_files>` to tell
PyOxidizer about pyflakes. Open the ``pyflakes/pyoxidizer.bzl`` file in your
favorite editor.

Find the ``make_exe()`` function. This function returns a
:ref:`config_type_python_executable` instance which defines
a standalone executable containing Python. This function is a registered
*target*, which is a named entity that can be individually built or run.
By returning a ``PythonExecutable`` instance, this function/target is saying
*build an executable containing Python*.

The ``PythonExecutable`` type holds all state needed to package and run
a Python interpreter. This includes low-level interpreter configuration
settings to which Python resources (like source and bytecode modules)
are embedded in that executable binary. This type exposes an
:ref:`add_python_resources() <config_python_executable_add_python_resources>`
method which adds an iterable of objects representing Python resources to the
set of embedded resources.

Elsewhere in this function, the ``dist`` variable holds an instance of
:ref:`config_type_python_distribution`. This type
represents a Python distribution, which is a fancy way of saying
*an implementation of Python*.

Two of the methods exposed by ``PythonExecutable`` are
:ref:`pip_download() <config_python_executable_pip_download>` and
:ref:`pip_install() <config_python_executable_pip_install>`, which
invoke ``pip`` commands with settings to target the built executable.

To add a new Python package to our executable, we call one of these
methods then add t he results to our ``PythonExecutable`` instance. This
is done like so:

.. code-block:: python

   exe.add_python_resources(exe.pip_download(["pyflakes==2.2.0"]))
   # or
   exe.add_python_resources(exe.pip_install(["pyflakes==2.2.0"]))

When called, these methods will effectively run ``pip download pyflakes==2.2.0``
or ``pip install pyflakes==2.2.0``, respectively. Actions are performed in
a temporary directory and after ``pip`` runs, PyOxidizer will collect all the
downloaded/installed resources (like module sources and bytecode data) and
return them as an iterable of Starlark values. The
``exe.add_python_resources()`` call will then teach the built executable
binary about the existence of these resources. Many resource types will be
embedded in the binary and loaded from binary. But some resource types (notably
compiled extension modules) may be installed next to the built binary and
loaded from the filesystem.

Next, we tell PyOxidizer to run ``pyflakes`` when the interpreter is executed:

.. code-block:: python

   python_config.run_code = "from pyflakes.api import main; main()"

This says to effectively run the Python code
``eval(from pyflakes.api import main; main())`` when the embedded interpreter
starts.

The new ``make_exe()`` function should look something like the following (with
comments removed for brevity):

.. code-block:: python

   def make_exe(dist):
       dist = default_python_distribution()

       policy = dist.make_python_packaging_policy()
       policy.extension_module_filter = "all"
       policy.include_distribution_sources = True
       policy.include_distribution_resources = True
       policy.include_test = False

       config = dist.make_python_interpreter_config()
       config.run_code = "from pyflakes.api import main; main()"

       exe = dist.to_python_executable(
           name="pyflakes",
           packaging_policy=policy,
           config=config,
       )

       exe.add_python_resources(exe.pip_install(["pyflakes==2.1.1"]))

       return exe

With the configuration changes made, we can build and run a ``pyflakes``
native executable::

   # From outside the ``pyflakes`` directory
   $ pyoxidizer run --path /path/to/pyflakes/project -- /path/to/python/file/to/analyze

   # From inside the ``pyflakes`` directory
   $ pyoxidizer run -- /path/to/python/file/to/analyze

   # Or if you prefer the Rust native tools
   $ cargo run -- /path/to/python/file/to/analyze

By default, ``pyflakes`` analyzes Python source code passed to it via
stdin.

.. _packaging_from_virtualenv:

Packaging an Application from an Existing Virtualenv
====================================================

This scenario is very similar to the above example. So we'll only briefly
describe what to do so we don't repeat ourselves.::

   $ pyoxidizer init-config-file /path/to/myapp

Now edit the ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` so the ``make_exe()`` function look like the
following:

.. code-block:: python

   def make_exe(dist):
       dist = default_python_distribution()

       policy = dist.make_python_packaging_policy()
       policy.extension_module_filter = "all"
       policy.include_distribution_sources = True
       policy.include_distribution_resources = False
       policy.include_test = False

       config = dist.make_python_interpreter_config()
       config.run_code = "from myapp import main; main()"

       exe = dist.to_python_executable(
           name="myapp",
           packaging_policy=policy,
           config=config,
       )

       exe.add_python_resources(exe.read_virtualenv("/path/to/virtualenv"))

       return exe

Of course, you need a populated virtualenv!::

   $ python3.8 -m venv /path/to/virtualenv
   $ /path/to/virtualenv/bin/pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt

Once all the pieces are in place, simply run ``pyoxidizer`` to build and
run the application::

    $ pyoxidizer run --path /path/to/myapp

.. warning::

   When consuming a pre-populated virtualenv, there may be compatibility
   differences between the Python distribution used to populate the virtualenv
   and the Python distributed used by PyOxidizer at build and application run
   time.

   For best results, it is recommended to use a packaging method like
   ``pip_install(...)`` or ``setup_py_install(...)`` to use PyOxidizer's
   Python distribution to invoke Python's packaging tools.

.. _packaging_from_local_python_package:

Packaging an Application from a Local Python Package
====================================================

Say you have a Python package/application in a local directory. It follows
the typical Python package layout and has a ``setup.py`` file and Python
files in sub-directories corresponding to the package name. e.g.::

   setup.py
   mypackage/__init__.py
   mypackage/foo.py

You have a number of choices as to how to proceed here. Again, the
workflow is very similar to what was explained above. The main difference
is the content of the ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` file and the exact
:ref:`method <packaging_python_executable_python_resource_methods>` to call
to obtain the Python resources.

You could use ``pip install <local path>`` to use ``pip`` to process a local
filesystem path:

.. code-block:: python

   exe.add_python_resources(exe.pip_install(["/path/to/local/package"]))

If the ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` file is in the same directory as the directory you
want to process, you can derive the absolute path to this directory via the
:ref:`CWD <config_cwd>` Starlark variable:

.. code-block:: python

   exe.add_python_resources(exe.pip_install([CWD]))

If you don't want to use ``pip`` and want to run ``setup.py`` directly,
you can do so:

.. code-block:: python

   exe.add_python_resources(exe.setup_py_install(package_path=CWD))

Or if you don't want to run a Python packaging tool at all and just
scan a directory tree for Python files:

.. code-block:: python

   exe.add_python_resources(exe.read_package_root(CWD, ["mypackage"]))

.. note::

   In this mode, all Python resources must already be in place in their
   final installation layout for things to work correctly. Many ``setup.py``
   files perform additional actions such as compiling Python extension
   modules, installing additional files, dynamically generating some files,
   or changing the final installation layout.

   For best results, use a packaging method that invokes a Python packaging
   tool (like ``pip_install(...)`` or ``setup_py_install(...)``.

.. _packaging_python_choosing:

Choosing Which Packaging Method to Call
=======================================

There are a handful of different methods for obtaining Python resources that
can be added to a resource collection. Which one should you use?

The reason there are so many methods is because the answer is: *it depends*.

Each method for obtaining resources has its niche use cases. That being said,
**the preferred method for obtaining Python resources is pip_download()**.
However, ``pip_download()`` may not work in all cases, which is why other
methods exist.

:ref:`config_python_executable_pip_download` runs ``pip download`` and
attempts to fetch Python wheels for specified packages, requirements files,
etc. It then extracts files from inside the wheel and converts them to
Python resources which can be added to resource collectors.

.. important::

   ``pip_download()`` will only work if a compatible Python *wheel* package
   (``.whl`` file) is available. If the configured Python package repository
   doesn't offer a compatible wheel for the specified package or any of its
   dependencies, the operation will fail.

   Many Python packages do not yet publish wheels (only ``.tar.gz`` archives)
   or don't publish at all to Python package repositories (this is common in
   corporate environments, where you don't want to publish your proprietary
   packages on PyPI or you don't run a Python package server).

.. important::

   Not all build targets support ``pip_download()`` for all published packages.
   For example, when targeting Linux musl libc, built binaries are fully static
   and aren't capable of loading Python extension modules (which are shared
   libraries). So ``pip_download()`` only supports source-only Python wheels
   in this configuration.

Another advantage of ``pip_download()`` is it supports cross-compiling.
Unlike ``pip install``, ``pip download`` supports arguments that tell it
which Python version, platform, implementation, etc to download packages
for. PyOxidizer automatically tells ``pip download`` to download wheels
that are compatible with the target environment you are building for. This
means you can do things like download wheels containing Windows binaries
when building on Linux.

.. note::

   Cross-compiling is not yet fully supported by PyOxidizer and likely
   doesn't work in many cases. However, this is a planned feature (at least
   for some configurations) and ``pip_download()`` is likely the most
   future-proof mechanism to support installing Python packages when
   cross-compiling.

A potential downside with ``pip_download()`` is that it only supports
classical Python binary loading/shipping techniques. If you are trying
to produce a statically linked executable containing custom Python
extension modules, ``pip_download()`` won't work for you.

After ``pip_download``,
:ref:`config_python_executable_pip_install` and
:ref:`config_python_executable_setup_py_install` are the next most-preferred
packaging methods.

Both of these work by locally running a Python packaging action
(``pip install`` or ``python setup.py install``, respectively) and then
collecting resources installed by that action.

The advantage over ``pip download`` is that a pre-built Python wheel
does not have to be available and published on a Python package repository
for these commands to work: you can run either against say a local version
control checkout of a Python project and it should work.

The main disadvantage over ``pip download`` is that you are running
Python packaging operations on the local machine as part of building
an executable. If your package contains just Python code, this should
*just work*. But if you need to compile extension modules, there's a
good chance your local machine may either not be able to build them
properly or will build those extension modules in such a way that
they aren't compatible with other machines you want to run them on.

The final options for obtaining Python resources are
:ref:`config_python_executable_read_package_root` and
:ref:`config_python_executable_read_virtualenv`. Both of these methods
rely on traversing a filesystem tree that is already populated with Python
resources. This should *just work* if only pure Python resources are in play.
**But if there are compiled Python extension modules, all bets are off and
there is no guarantee that found extension modules will be compatible with
PyOxidizer or will have binary compatibility with other machines.** These
resource discovery mechanisms also rely on state not under the control of
PyOxidizer and therefore packaging results may be highly inconsistent and
not reproducible across runs. For these reasons, **read_package_root()
and read_virtualenv() are the least preferred methods for Python resource
discovery.**
