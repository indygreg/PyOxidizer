Version History
===============

0.8.0-pre
---------

Not yet released.

0.7.0
-----

Released April 9, 2020.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Packages imported from memory using PyOxidizer now set ``__path__`` with
  a value formed by joining the current executable's path with the package
  name. This mimics the behavior of ``zipimport``.
* Resolved Python resource names have changed behavior. See the note in the
  bug fixes section below.
* The ``PythonDistribution.to_python_executable()`` Starlark method has added
  a ``resources_policy`` named argument as its 2nd argument / 1st named
  argument. If you were affected by this, you should add argument names to all
  arguments passed to this method.
* The default Rust project for built executables now builds executables such
  that dynamic symbols are exported from the executable. This change is
  necessary in order to support executables loading Python extension modules,
  which are shared libraries which need access to Python symbols defined
  in executables.
* The ``PythonResourceData`` Starlark type has been renamed to
  ``PythonPackageResource``.
* The ``PythonDistribution.resources_data()`` Starlark method has been
  renamed to ``PythonDistribution.package_resources()``.
* The ``PythonExecutable.to_embedded_data()`` Starlark method has been
  renamed to ``PythonExecutable.to_embedded_resources()``.
* The ``PythonEmbeddedData`` Starlark type has been renamed to
  ``PythonEmbeddedResources``.
* The format of Python resource data embedded in binaries has been completely
  rewritten. The separate modules and resource data structures have been merged
  into a single data structure. Embedded resources data can now express more
  primitives such as package distribution metadata and different bytecode
  optimization levels.
* The `pyembed` crate now has a *dev* dependency on the `pyoxidizer` crate in
  order to run tests.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* PyOxidizer's importer now always sets ``__path__`` on imported packages
  in accordance with Python's stated behavior (#51).
* The mechanism for resolving Python resource files from the filesystem has
  been rewritten. Before, it was possible for files like
  ``package/resources/foo.txt`` to be normalized to a (package, resource_name)
  tuple of `(package, resources.foo.txt)`, which was weird and not compatible
  with Python's resource loading mechanism. Resources in sub-directories should
  no longer encounter munging of directory separators to ``.``. In the above
  example, the resource path will now be expressed as
  ``(package, resources/foo.txt)``.
* Certain packaging actions are only performed once during building instead of
  twice. The user-visible impact of this change is that some duplicate log
  messages no longer appear.
* Added a missing `)` for `add_python_resources()` in auto-generated
  `pyoxidizer.bzl` files.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Python resource scanning now recognizes ``*.dist-info`` and ``*.egg-info``
  directories as package distribution metadata. Files within these directories
  are exposed to Starlark as :ref:`config_python_package_distribution_resource`
  instances. These resources can be added to the embedded resources payload
  and made available for loading from memory or the filesystem, just like
  any other resource. The custom Python importer implements ``get_distributions()``
  and returns objects that expose package distribution files. However,
  functionality of the returned *distribution* objects is not yet complete.
  See :ref:`packaging_importlib_metadata_compatibility` for details.
* The custom Python importer now implements ``get_data(path)``, allowing loading
  of resources from filesystem paths (#139).
* The ``PythonDistribution.to_python_executable()`` Starlark method now accepts
  a ``resources_policy`` argument to control a policy and default behavior for
  resources on the produced executable. Using this argument, it is possible
  to control how resources should be materialized. For example, you can specify
  that resources should be loaded from memory if supported and from the filesystem
  if not. The argument can also be used to materialize the Python standard library
  on the filesystem, like how Python distributions typically work.
* Python resources can now be installed next to built binaries using the new
  Starlark functions ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_module_source()``,
  ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_module_bytecode()``,
  ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_package_resource()``,
  ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_extension_module()``,
  ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_python_resource()``,
  ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_package_distribution_resource()``,
  and ``PythonExecutable.add_filesystem_relative_python_resources()``. Unlike
  adding Python resources to ``FileManifest`` instances, Python resources added
  this way have their metadata serialized into the built executable. This allows
  the special Python module importer present in built binaries to service the
  ``import`` request without going through Python's default filesystem-based
  importer. Because metadata for the file-based Python resources is *frozen* into
  the application, Python has to do far less work at run-time to load resources,
  making operations faster. Resources loaded from the filesystem in this manner
  have attributes like ``__file__``, ``__cached__``, and ``__path__`` set,
  emulating behavior of the default Python importer. The custom import now also
  implements the ``importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader`` interface.
* Windows binaries can now import extension modules defined as shared libraries
  (e.g. ``.pyd`` files) from memory. PyOxidizer will detect ``.pyd`` files during
  packaging and embed them into the binary as resources. When the module
  is imported, the extension module/shared library is loaded from memory
  and initialized. This feature enables PyOxidizer to package pre-built
  extension modules (e.g. from Windows binary wheels published on PyPI)
  while still maintaining the property of a (mostly) self-contained
  executable.
* Multiple bytecode optimization levels can now be embedded in binaries.
  Previously, it was only possible to embed bytecode for a given module
  at a single optimization level.
* The ``default_python_distribution()`` Starlark function now accepts values
  ``standalone_static`` and ``standalone_dynamic`` to specify a *standalone*
  distribution that is either statically or dynamically linked.
* Support for parsing version 4 of the ``PYTHON.json`` distribution descriptor
  present in standalone Python distribution archives.
* Default Python distributions upgraded to CPython 3.7.7.

Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The directory for downloaded Python distributions in the build directory
  now uses a truncated SHA-256 hash instead of the full hash to help avoid
  path length limit issues (#224).
* The documentation for the ``pyembed`` crate has been moved out of the
  Sphinx documentation and into the Rust crate itself. Rendered docs can be
  seen by following the *Documentation* link at https://crates.io/crates/pyembed
  or by running ``cargo doc`` from a source checkout.

.. _version_0_6_0:

0.6.0
-----

Released February 12, 2020.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``default_python_distribution()`` Starlark function now accepts a ``flavor``
  argument denoting the distribution flavor.
* The ``pyembed`` crate no longer includes the auto-generated default configuration
  file. Instead, it is consumed by the application that instantiates a Python
  interpreter.
* Rust projects for the main executable now utilize and require a Cargo build script
  so metadata can be passed from ``pyembed`` to the project that is consuming it.
* The ``pyembed`` crate is no longer added to created Rust projects. Instead,
  the generated ``Cargo.toml`` will reference a version of the ``pyembed`` crate
  identical to the ``PyOxidizer`` version currently running. Or if ``pyoxidizer``
  is running from a Git checkout of the canonical ``PyOxidizer`` Git repository,
  a local filesystem path will be used.
* The fields of ``EmbeddedPythonConfig`` and ``pyembed::PythonConfig`` have been
  renamed and reordered to align with Python 3.8's config API naming. This was done
  for the Starlark type in version 0.5. We have made similar changes to 0.6 so
  naming is consistent across the various types.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Module names without a ``.`` are now properly recognized when scanning the
  filesystem for Python resources and a package allow list is used (#223).
  Previously, if filtering scanned resources through an explicit list of allowed
  packages, the top-level module/package without a dot in its full name would not
  be passed through the filter.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``PythonDistribution()`` Starlark function now accepts a ``flavor`` argument
  to denote the distribution type. This allows construction of alternate distribution
  types.
* The ``default_python_distribution()`` Starlark function now accepts a
  ``flavor`` argument which can be set to ``windows_embeddable`` to return a
  distribution based on the zip file distributions published by the official
  CPython project.
* The ``pyembed`` crate and generated Rust projects now have various
  ``build-mode-*`` feature flags to control how build artifacts are built. See
  :ref:`rust_projects` for more.
* The ``pyembed`` crate can now be built standalone, without being bound to
  a specific ``PyOxidizer`` configuration.
* The ``register_target()`` Starlark function now accepts an optional
  ``default_build_script`` argument to define the default target when
  evaluating in *Rust build script* mode.
* The ``pyembed`` crate now builds against published ``cpython`` and
  ``python3-sys`` crates instead of a a specific Git commit.
* Embedded Python interpreters can now be configured to run a file specified
  by a filename. See the ``run_file`` argument of
  :ref:`config_python_interpreter_config`.

Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Rust internals have been overhauled to use traits to represent various types,
  namely Python distributions. The goal is to allow different Python
  distribution flavors to implement different logic for building binaries.
* The ``pyembed`` crate's ``build.rs`` has been tweaked so it can support
  calling out to ``pyoxidizer``. It also no longer has a build dependency
  on ``pyoxidizer``.

.. _version_0_5_1:

0.5.1
-----

Released January 26, 2020.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fixed bad Starlark example for building ``black`` in docs.
* Remove resources attached to packages that don't exist. (This was a
  regression in 0.5.)
* Warn on failure to annotate a package. (This was a regression in 0.5.)
* Building embedded Python resources now emits warnings when ``__file__``
  is seen. (This was a regression in 0.5.)
* Missing parent packages are now automatically added when constructing
  embedded resources. (This was a regression in 0.5.)

.. _version_0_5_0:

0.5.0
-----

Released January 26, 2020.

General Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release of PyOxidizer is significant rewrite of the previous version.
The impetus for the rewrite is to transition from TOML to Starlark
configuration files. The new configuration file format should allow
vastly greater flexibility for building applications and will unlock a
world of new possibilities.

The transition to Starlark configuration files represented a shift from
static configuration to something more dynamic. This required refactoring
a ton of code.

As part of refactoring code, we took the opportunity to shore up lots
of the code base. PyOxidizer was the project author's first real Rust
project and a lot of bad practices (such as use of `.unwrap()`/panics)
were prevalent. The code mostly now has proper error handling. Another
new addition to the code is unit tests. While coverage still isn't
great, we now have tests performing meaningful packaging activities.
So regressions should hopefully be less common going forward.

Because of the scale of the rewritten code in this release, it is expected
that there are tons of bugs of regressions. This will likely be a transitional
release with a more robust release to follow.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for building distributions/installers has been temporarily dropped.
* Support for installing license files has been temporarily dropped.
* Python interpreter configuration setting names have been changed to reflect
  names from Python 3.8's interpreter initialization API.
* ``.egg-info`` directories are now ignored when scanning for Python resources
  on the filesystem (matching the behavior for ``.dist-info`` directories).
* The ``pyoxidizer init`` sub-command has been renamed to ``init-rust-project``.
* The ``pyoxidizer app-path`` sub-command has been removed.
* Support for building distributions has been removed.
* The minimum Rust version to build has been increased from 1.31 to
  1.36. This is mainly due to requirements from the ``starlark``
  crate. We could potentially reduce the minimum version requirements
  again with minimal changes to 3rd party crates.
* PyOxidizer configuration files are now
  `Starlark <https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark>`_ instead of TOML
  files. The default file name is ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` instead of
  ``pyoxidizer.toml``. All existing configuration files will need to be
  ported to the new format.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``repl`` run mode now properly exits with a non-zero exit code
  if an error occurs.
* Compiled C extensions now properly honor the ``ext_package`` argument
  passed to ``setup()``, resulting in extensions which properly have
  the package name in their extension name (#26).

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A :ref:`config_glob` function has been added to config files to allow
  referencing existing files on the filesystem.
* The in-memory ``MetaPathFinder`` now implements ``find_module()``.
* A ``pyoxidizer init-config-file`` command has been implemented to create
  just a ``pyoxidizer.bzl`` configuration file.
* A ``pyoxidizer python-distribution-info`` command has been implemented
  to print information about a Python distribution archive.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a
  ``legacy_windows_stdio`` argument to control the value of
  ``Py_LegacyWindowsStdioFlag`` (#190).
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a
  ``legacy_windows_fs_encoding`` argument to control the value of
  ``Py_LegacyWindowsFSEncodingFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts an ``isolated``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_IsolatedFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a ``use_hash_seed``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_HashRandomizationFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts an ``inspect``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_InspectFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts an ``interactive``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_InteractiveFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a ``quiet``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_QuietFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a ``verbose``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_VerboseFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a ``parser_debug``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_DebugFlag``.
* The ``EmbeddedPythonConfig()`` config function now accepts a ``bytes_warning``
  argument to control the value of ``Py_BytesWarningFlag``.
* The ``Stdlib()`` packaging rule now now accepts an optional ``excludes``
  list of modules to ignore. This is useful for removing unnecessary
  Python packages such as ``distutils``, ``pip``, and ``ensurepip``.
* The ``PipRequirementsFile()`` and ``PipInstallSimple()`` packaging rules
  now accept an optional ``extra_env`` dict of extra environment variables
  to set when invoking ``pip install``.
* The ``PipRequirementsFile()`` packaging rule now accepts an optional
  ``extra_args`` list of extra command line arguments to pass to
  ``pip install``.

Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* PyOxidizer no longer requires a forked version of the ``rust-cpython``
  project (the ``python3-sys`` and ``cpython`` crates. All changes required
  by PyOxidizer are now present in the official project.

.. _version_0_4_0:

0.4.0
-----

Released October 27, 2019.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``setup-py-install`` packaging rule now has its ``package_path``
  evaluated relative to the PyOxidizer config file path rather than the
  current working directory.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Windows now explicitly requires dynamic linking against ``msvcrt``.
  Previously, this wasn't explicit. And sometimes linking the final
  executable would result in unresolved symbol errors because the Windows
  Python distributions used external linkage of CRT symbols and for some
  reason Cargo wasn't dynamically linking the CRT.
* Read-only files in Python distributions are now made writable to avoid
  future permissions errors (#123).
* In-memory ``InspectLoader.get_source()`` implementation no longer errors
  due to passing a ``memoryview`` to a function that can't handle it (#134).
* In-memory ``ResourceReader`` now properly handles multiple resources (#128).

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Added an ``app-path`` command that prints the path to a packaged
  application. This command can be useful for tools calling PyOxidizer,
  as it will emit the path containing the packaged files without forcing
  the caller to parse command output.
* The ``setup-py-install`` packaging rule now has an ``excludes`` option
  that allows ignoring specific packages or modules.
* ``.py`` files installed into app-relative locations now have corresponding
  ``.pyc`` bytecode files written.
* The ``setup-py-install`` packaging rule now has an ``extra_global_arguments``
  option to allow passing additional command line arguments to the ``setup.py``
  invocation.
* Packaging rules that invoke ``pip`` or ``setup.py`` will now set a
  ``PYOXIDIZER=1`` environment variable so Python code knows at packaging
  time whether it is running in the context of PyOxidizer.
* The ``setup-py-install`` packaging rule now has an ``extra_env`` option to
  allow passing additional environment variables to ``setup.py`` invocations.
* ``[[embedded_python_config]]`` now supports a ``sys_frozen`` flag to control
  setting ``sys.frozen = True``.
* ``[[embedded_python_config]]`` now supports a ``sys_meipass`` flag to control
  setting ``sys._MEIPASS = <exe directory>``.
* Default Python distribution upgraded to 3.7.5 (from 3.7.4). Various
  dependency packages also upgraded to latest versions.

All Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Built extension modules marked as app-relative are now embedded in the
  final binary rather than being ignored.

.. _version_0_3_0:

0.3.0
-----

Released on August 16, 2019.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The ``pyembed::PythonConfig`` struct now has an additional
  ``extra_extension_modules`` field.
* The default musl Python distribution now uses LibreSSL instead of
  OpenSSL. This should hopefully be an invisible change.
* Default Python distributions now use CPython 3.7.4 instead of 3.7.3.
* Applications are now built into directories named
  ``apps/<app_name>/<target>/<build_type>`` rather than
  ``apps/<app_name>/<build_type>``. This enables builds for multiple targets
  to coexist in an application's output directory.
* The ``program_name`` field from the ``[[embedded_python_config]]`` config
  section has been removed. At run-time, the current executable's path is
  always used when calling ``Py_SetProgramName()``.
* The format of embedded Python module data has changed. The ``pyembed`` crate
  and ``pyoxidizer`` versions must match exactly or else the ``pyembed`` crate
  will likely crash at run-time when parsing module data.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* The ``libedit`` extension variant for the ``readline`` extension should now
  link on Linux. Before, attempting to link a binary using this extension
  variant would result in missing symbol errors.
* The ``setup-py-install`` ``[[packaging_rule]]`` now performs actions to
  appease ``setuptools``, thus allowing installation of packages using
  ``setuptools`` to (hopefully) work without issue (#70).
* The ``virtualenv`` ``[[packaging_rule]]`` now properly finds the
  ``site-packages`` directory on Windows (#83).
* The ``filter-include`` ``[[packaging_rule]]`` no longer requires both
  ``files`` and ``glob_files`` be defined (#88).
* ``import ctypes`` now works on Windows (#61).
* The in-memory module importer now implements ``get_resource_reader()`` instead
  of ``get_resource_loader()``. (The CPython documentation steered us in the
  wrong direction - https://bugs.python.org/issue37459.)
* The in-memory module importer now correctly populates ``__package__`` in
  more cases than it did previously. Before, whether a module was a package
  was derived from the presence of a ``foo.bar`` module. Now, a module will be
  identified as a package if the file providing it is named ``__init__``. This
  more closely matches the behavior of Python's filesystem based importer. (#53)

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The default Python distributions have been updated. Archives are generally
  about half the size from before. Tcl/tk is included in the Linux and macOS
  distributions (but PyOxidizer doesn't yet package the Tcl files).
* Extra extension modules can now be registered with ``PythonConfig`` instances.
  This can be useful for having the application embedding Python provide its
  own extension modules without having to go through Python build mechanisms
  to integrate those extension modules into the Python executable parts.
* Built applications now have the ability to detect and use ``terminfo``
  databases on the execution machine. This allows applications to interact
  with terminals properly. (e.g. the backspace key will now work in interactive
  ``pdb`` sessions). By default, applications on non-Windows platforms will
  look for ``terminfo`` databases at well-known locations and attempt to load
  them.
* Default Python distributions now use CPython 3.7.4 instead of 3.7.3.
* A warning is now emitted when a Python source file contains ``__file__``. This
  should help trace down modules using ``__file__``.
* Added 32-bit Windows distribution.
* New ``pyoxidizer distribution`` command for producing distributable artifacts
  of applications. Currently supports building tar archives and ``.msi`` and
  ``.exe`` installers using the WiX Toolset.
* Libraries required by C extensions are now passed into the linker as
  library dependencies. This should allow C extensions linked against
  libraries to be embedded into produced executables.
* ``pyoxidizer --verbose`` will now pass verbose to invoked ``pip`` and
  ``setup.py`` scripts. This can help debug what Python packaging tools are
  doing.

All Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The list of modules being added by the Python standard library is
  no longer printed during rule execution unless ``--verbose`` is used.
  The output was excessive and usually not very informative.

.. _version_0_2_0:

0.2.0
-----

Released on June 30, 2019.

Backwards Compatibility Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Applications are now built into an ``apps/<appname>/(debug|release)``
  directory instead of ``apps/<appname>``. This allows debug and release
  builds to exist side-by-side.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Extracted ``.egg`` directories in Python package directories should now have
  their resources detected properly and not as Python packages with the name
  ``*.egg``.
* ``site-packages`` directories are now recognized as Python resource package
  roots and no longer have their contents packaged under a ``site-packages``
  Python package.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for building and embedding C extensions on Windows, Linux, and macOS
  in many circumstances. See :ref:`status_extension_modules` for support status.
* ``pyoxidizer init`` now accepts a ``--pip-install`` option to pre-configure
  generated ``pyoxidizer.toml`` files with packages to install via ``pip``.
  Combined with the ``--python-code`` option, it is now possible to create
  ``pyoxidizer.toml`` files for a ready-to-use Python application!
* ``pyoxidizer`` now accepts a ``--verbose`` flag to make operations more
  verbose. Various low-level output is no longer printed by default and
  requires ``--verbose`` to see.

All Other Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Packaging now automatically creates empty modules for missing parent
  packages. This prevents a module from being packaged without its parent.
  This could occur with *namespace packages*, for example.
* ``pip-install-simple`` rule now passes ``--no-binary :all:`` to pip.
* Cargo packages updated to latest versions.

0.1.3
-----

Released on June 29, 2019.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix Python refcounting bug involving call to ``PyImport_AddModule()`` when
  ``mode = module`` evaluation mode is used. The bug would likely lead to
  a segfault when destroying the Python interpreter. (#31)
* Various functionality will no longer fail when running ``pyoxidizer`` from
  a Git repository that isn't the canonical ``PyOxidizer`` repository. (#34)

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``pyoxidizer init`` now accepts a ``--python-code`` option to control which
  Python code is evaluated in the produced executable. This can be used to
  create applications that do not run a Python REPL by default.
* ``pip-install-simple`` packaging rule now supports ``excludes`` for excluding
  resources from packaging. (#21)
* ``pip-install-simple`` packaging rule now supports ``extra_args`` for adding
  parameters to the pip install command. (#42)

All Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Minimum Rust version decreased to 1.31 (the first Rust 2018 release). (#24)
* Added CI powered by Azure Pipelines. (#45)
* Comments in auto-generated ``pyoxidizer.toml`` have been tweaked to
  improve understanding. (#29)

0.1.2
-----

Released on June 25, 2019.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Honor ``HTTP_PROXY`` and ``HTTPS_PROXY`` environment variables when
  downloading Python distributions. (#15)
* Handle BOM when compiling Python source files to bytecode. (#13)

All Relevant Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``pyoxidizer`` now verifies the minimum Rust version meets requirements
  before building.

0.1.1
-----

Released on June 24, 2019.

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* ``pyoxidizer`` binaries built from crates should now properly
  refer to an appropriate commit/tag in PyOxidizer's canonical Git
  repository in auto-generated ``Cargo.toml`` files. (#11)

0.1
---

Released on June 24, 2019. This is the initial formal release of PyOxidizer.
The first ``pyoxidizer`` crate was published to ``crates.io``.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Support for building standalone, single file executables embedding Python
  for 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* Support for importing Python modules from memory using zero-copy.
* Basic Python packaging support.
* Support for jemalloc as Python's memory allocator.
* ``pyoxidizer`` CLI command with basic support for managing project
  lifecycle.
