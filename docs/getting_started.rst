Installing
==========

Installing Rust
---------------

PyOxidizer is a Rust application and requires Rust 1.33+ to be installed in
order to build PyOxidizer itself as well as Python application binaries.

You can verify your installed version of Rust by running::

   $ rustc --version
   rustc 1.35.0 (3c235d560 2019-05-20)

If you don't have Rust installed, https://www.rust-lang.org/ has very detailed
instructions on how to install it.

Rust releases a new version every 6 weeks and language development moves
faster than other programming languages. It is common for the Rust packages
provided by common package managers to lag behind the latest Rust release by
several releases. For that reason, use of the ``rustup`` tool for managing
Rust is highly recommended.

If you are a security paranoid individual and don't want to follow the
official ``rustup`` install instructions involving a ``curl | sh`` (your
paranoia is understood), you can find instructions for alternative installation
methods at https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs/#other-installation-methods.

Installing PyOxidizer
---------------------

PyOxidizer can be installed from its latest published crate::

   $ cargo install pyoxidizer

From a Git repository using cargo::

   # The latest commit in source control.
   $ cargo install --git https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git --branch main pyoxidizer

   $ A specific release
   $ cargo install --git https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git --tag <TAG> pyoxidizer

Or by cloning the Git repository and building the project locally::

   $ git clone https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git
   $ cd PyOxidizer
   $ cargo install --path pyoxidizer

.. note::

   PyOxidizer's project policy is for the ``main`` branch to be stable. So it
   should always be relatively safe to use ``main`` instead of a released
   version.

Once the ``pyoxidizer`` executable is installed, try to run it::

   $ pyoxidizer
   PyOxidizer 0.1

   Build and distribute Python applications

   USAGE:
       pyoxidizer [SUBCOMMAND]

   ...

Congratulations, PyOxidizer is installed! Now let's move on to using it.

Your First PyOxidizer Project
=============================

The ``pyoxidizer init`` command will create a new [Rust] project which supports
embedding Python. Invoke it with the directory you want to create your new
project in::

   $ pyoxidizer init pyapp

This should have printed out details on what happened and what to do next.
If you actually ran this in a terminal, hopefully you don't need to continue
following the directions here as the printed instructions are sufficient!
But if you aren't, keep reading.

The default project created by ``pyoxidizer init`` will produce an
executable that embeds Python and starts a Python REPL by default. Let's
test that::

   $ cd pyapp
   $ pyoxidizer run
   no existing PyOxidizer artifacts found
   processing config file /home/gps/src/pyapp/pyoxidizer.toml
   resolving Python distribution...
   ...
      Compiling pyapp v0.1.0 (/home/gps/src/pyapp)
       Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 53.14s
        Running `target/debug/testapp`
   >>>

If all goes according to plan, you just started a Rust executable which
started a Python interpreter, which started an interactive Python debugger!
Try typing in some Python code::

   >>> print("hello, world")
   hello, world

It works!

(To exit the REPL, press CTRL+d or CTRL+z.)

Continue reading :ref:`managing_projects` to learn more about the
``pyoxidizer`` tool. Or read on for a preview of how to customize your
application's behavior.

Customizing Python and Packaging Behavior
=========================================

Embedding Python in a Rust executable and starting a REPL is cool and all.
But you probably want to do something more exciting.

Inside the project's root directory is an autogenerated ``pyoxidizer.toml``
file. This file configures how the embedded Python interpreter is built as
well as defines default run-time behavior. See :ref:`new_project_layout` if
you are interested in what all the files do.

Open ``pyoxidizer.toml`` in your favorite editor and find the ``[[python_run]]``
section. This section configures what to do when the interpreter starts.
By default, it should have a ``mode = "repl"`` line. Let's comment that out
or delete it and replace it with the following::

   [[embedded_python_run]]
   mode = "eval"
   code = "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"

We're now telling the interpreter to effectively run the Python statement
``eval(import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())`` when it starts. Test that out::

   $ pyoxidizer run
      Compiling pyembed v0.1.0 (/home/gps/src/pyapp/pyembed)
      Compiling pyapp v0.1.0 (/home/gps/src/pyapp)
       Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.92s
        Running `target/debug/pyapp`
   96f776c8-c32d-48d8-8c1c-aef8a735f535

It works!

This is still pretty trivial. But it demonstrates how the ``pyoxidizer.toml``
is used to influence the behavior of built binaries.

Let's do something a little bit more complicated, like package an existing
Python application!

Find the existing ``[[python_packages]]`` section in the ``pyoxidizer.toml``.
Now let's add the following lines after the last of those sections::

   [[packaging_rule]]
   type = "pip-install-simple"
   package = "pyflakes==2.1.1"

And change the ``[[embedded_python_run]]`` section to::

   [[embedded_python_run]]
   mode = "eval"
   code = "from pyflakes.api import main; main()"

This tells PyOxidizer that you want to install version 2.1.1 of the ``pyflakes``
package. At build time, this will effectively perform a
``pip install pyflakes==2.1.1`` and take all installed files and add them to the
produced binary. Let's try that::

   $ pyoxidizer run -- --help
      Compiling pyembed v0.1.0 (/home/gps/tmp/pyapp/pyembed)
      Compiling pyapp v0.1.0 (/home/gps/tmp/pyapp)
       Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 5.49s
        Running `target/debug/pyapp --help`
   Usage: pyapp [options]

   Options:
     --version   show program's version number and exit
     -h, --help  show this help message and exit

You've just produced an executable for pyflakes!

There are far more powerful packaging and configuration settings available.
Read all about them at :ref:`config_files` and :ref:`packaging`. Or continue
on to :ref:`managing_projects` to learn more about the ``pyoxidizer`` tool.
