.. _config_set_build_path:

``set_build_path()``
====================

Configure the directory where build artifacts will be written.

Build artifacts include Rust build state, files generated by PyOxidizer,
staging areas for built binaries, etc.

If a relative path is passed, it is interpreted as relative to the
directory containing the configuration file.

The default value is ``$CWD/build``.

.. important::

   This needs to be called before functionality that utilizes the build path,
   otherwise the default value will be used.
