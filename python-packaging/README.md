# About

This crate contains data structures and functions related to Python
packaging. It's goal is to support interacting with Python resources
and performing packaging-like mechanisms without the involvement of
Python.

This crate is developed as part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project. But
it can be used without PyOxidizer.
